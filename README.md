# TkMusic
A music player written in python, that uses Tkinter and the vlc-python module

With **TkMusic** you can create a playlist and play countless audio files. Even with extremely long playlists the app works (the new Windows Media Player didn't even start).
If you have a big music collection, but all files are missing their metadata tags, then this audio player can fix it for you. You can edit a batch of audio files and add their metadata tags that are read from the filename.

- Supports a lot of formats
- Supports m3u and m3u8 playlist files
- Able to read metadata from song (Title, Artist, Song Cover)
- Able to edit the metadata of m4a and mp3 files

There is also a version without the metadata editor available, all other features are the same.
The metadata editor is also available as a standalone application.
